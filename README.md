## üöÄ About

This repository is created to **welcome contributions from the community**. It does not contain official charts from OpenCloud GmbH and is **not officially supported by OpenCloud GmbH**. Instead, these charts are maintained by the open-source community.

OpenCloud is a cloud collaboration platform that provides file sync and share, document collaboration, and more. This Helm chart deploys OpenCloud with Keycloak for authentication, MinIO for object storage, and multiple options for document editing including Collabora and OnlyOffice.
